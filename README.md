1. OLTP - Online Transaction Processing Databases
2. OLAP - Online Analytic Processing Databases
3. MPP - Massively Parallel Processing
4. 
5. LTS - Long Term Support
6. SQL - Structured Query Language
7. **SSAS**:  SSAS is Microsoft SQL Serverâ€™s Analysis Services which is an online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining and reporting tool used in Business Intelligence to make your data work for you.
8. **SSIS**: SSIS stands for Sql Server Integration Services. The key power of SSIS is its data transformation and migration capability. When building a data warehouse or a data mart, the data needs to be extracted out of the various transactional systems and flat files, transformed and loaded to where it can then be analyzed and reported on. The data extraction, transformation and loading are known as ETL and is a common term in data migration and Business Intelligence.
9. **SSRS**: SSRS stands for Sql Server Reporting Services. Once data is in its final state, either in the native transactional system or transformed into a datamart or datawarehouse, SSRS provides the tools necessary to create reports to better understand your data. These three tools are often used together to support your data analysis needs and come part of Microsoft Sql Server and the Microsoft Business Intelligence package.
